# CECS-323-JDBC
Create a .sql file for the DDL and run this script to create the database, tables, etc. and for the DML used to populate the tables.
Write a JDBC program to support the following functions:

    Create a simple menu to run all of the options below:
    List all writing groups
    List all the data for a group specified by the user .
    This includes all the data for the associated books and publishers.
    List all publishers
    List all the data for a pubisher specified by the user.
    This includes all the data for the associated books and writing groups.
    List all book titles
    List all the data for a single book specified by the user.
    This includes all the data for the associated publisher and writing group.
    Insert a new book
    Insert a new publisher and update all book published by one publisher to be published by the new pubisher.
    This requirement is two separate operations. The idea is that a new publisher, (xyz) buys out an existing publisher (abc). After the new publisher is added to the database, all books that are currently published by abc will now be published by xyz.
    Remove a single book specified by the user 

Folder includes sample output, java code, and sql to build tables.
